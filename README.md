### Vision-guided Navigation Assistance for the Visually Impaired
#### Problem Description:

Our goal is to build an app that can guide a visually impaired user toward a Montreal bus shelter, DoorWay  and Intersection Crossing Detection using image recognition and navigation assistance. The application aims to address the problems faced by the visually impaired community surrounding their mobility in modern urban environments.

 We seek to provide accurate navigational guidance, as there exists no current solution that can efficiently and reliably identify these crucial problems.
