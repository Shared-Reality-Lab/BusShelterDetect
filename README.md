# SIGHT
## Vision-Guided Navigation Assistance for the Visually Impaired

### Introduction:
SIGHT is designed to revolutionize mobility for the visually impaired within urban environments. By leveraging advanced image recognition technologies, the app provides precise guidance to vital urban locations such as Montreal bus shelters, doorways, and intersection crossings.

### Problem Statement:
Navigating complex urban environments poses significant challenges for visually impaired individuals. Existing solutions often fall short in efficiently and reliably identifying essential navigation points necessary for safe and independent mobility. SIGHT addresses this critical gap, enhancing the mobility of the visually impaired community with accurate navigational assistance.

### Solution Overview:
Project Amish utilizes the widespread availability and capabilities of smartphones, which may be carried on a neck-worn lanyard or integrated with external devices such as head-worn panoramic cameras. Key features of the application include:

1. **Intersection Safety**: Enhances safe passage across intersections by preventing veering, reducing stress and danger.
2. **Doorway Navigation**: Assists users in precisely navigating to doorways, especially in the last few meters of their approach.
3. **Environmental Awareness**: Guides users to important environmental features such as stairways and bus shelters.
4. **Service Integration**: Seamlessly switches between various app services, including navigation, OCR (Optical Character Recognition), product identification, and environmental description. This integration is based on contextual information and personalization to enhance user experience.

### Development Strategy:
Our approach combines advanced machine learning techniques with an extensive image dataset, potentially augmented by crowdsourcing. Iterative design and feedback mechanisms, informed by our labâ€™s experience with sensor-based intersection crossing assistance systems, are integral to the development process.
